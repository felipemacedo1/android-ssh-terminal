## Code Style

We follow Kotlin conventions and the [Android Architecture Components guidelines](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

### Key Points

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only for complex logic
- Use Kotlin idioms (prefer `val` over `var`, use scoping functions appropriately)

### Running Linting

```bash
./gradlew lint
./gradlew ktlint
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write instrumentation tests for UI components
- Run tests before submitting PR:

```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
